Todo:
- Robot
    - Robot LED (What state it is in)
    - Robot InfraRed communication
    - Robot detect safe-zone
    - Robot detect other robots
    - Robot detect other robots state

- Simulation
    - Make map
    - Create robots
    - Implement tag-and-avoid behavior
    - Make simulation as close to reality as possible, i.e how long the camera can see, how far the infrared can be detected
