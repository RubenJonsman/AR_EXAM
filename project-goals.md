1. You are free to use any approach, sensor and robot (taught/used in the course)

2. It is expected that you employ some form of robot learning or evolutionary robotics, but maybe this is not where you want to start.

3. A seeker robot has to turn its LEDs red and if in the safe zone orange.
4. An avoider robot has to turn its LEDs blue, but if it is safe green and if it is tagged purple (due to embarrassment).
5. A seeker transmits “1” and if an avoider receives this it is tagged and has to stand still.
6. An avoider transmits “2” and if an avoider in the safe zone receives this it has to leave immediately and can first after 5 seconds begin to transmit “2”.
7. It is essential that you focus on how to make a robot that performs well also in practice.
